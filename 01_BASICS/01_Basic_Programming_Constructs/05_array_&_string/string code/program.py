# Creating a string
s = "Hello, World!"

# Accessing characters of a string
print(s[0])  # Output: H

# Modifying a string
# Strings are immutable in Python, so we cannot modify them directly.
# We can create a new string by concatenating or using string manipulation methods.
s = s.replace("Hello", "Hi")
print(s)  # Output: Hi, World!
